In a colorful town called Codeville, there was a friendly software wizard named Bob.
Bob loved to play with computer codes and make digital magic happen.


One sunny morning, Bob woke up excited to work on his computer.
But oh no! His computer screen stayed dark.

It seemed to be taking a nap. Bob tried tapping the keys, but nothing happened.
He scratched his head, wondering what to do.


Instead of getting upset, Bob decided to have a little fun.
He grabbed his magic wand (which was really just a remote control) and waved it at the screen.

To his surprise, the screen flickered to life!
Bob laughed and thought, "Wow, my wand still works!"
